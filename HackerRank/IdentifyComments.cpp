//Jack wants to build an IDE on his own. Help him build a feature which identifies the comments, 
//in the source code of computer programs. Assume, that the programs are written either in C, C++ or Java. 
//The commenting conventions are displayed here, for your convenience. 

//At this point of time you only need to handle simple and common kinds of comments. 
//You donâ€™t need to handle nested comments, or multi-line comments inside single comments or single-comments inside multi-line comments.

//Your task is to write a program, 
//which accepts as input, a C or C++ or Java program and outputs only the comments from those programs. 
//Your program will be tested on source codes of not more than 200 lines.
