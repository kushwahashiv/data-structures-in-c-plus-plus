 * There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
 * You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
 *  1. Each child must have at least one candy.
 *  2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
 * What is the minimum candies you must give?
 *
 * Tricks:
 *  1. 2-way scan the array: forward and backward

     * 2. forward scan: if ith child rating higher than i-1th, give one more than i-1th
     * 3. backward scan: if i-1th child rating higher than ith, and candy is lesser than ith, give one more than ith.
