/**
 * Created by chenting on 2014/6/26.
 *
 * Karel is a frustrated painter who works by day in an electrical repair shop.
 * Inspired by the color-coded bands on resistors, he is painting a series of long, narrow canvases with bold colored stripes.
 * However, Karel is lazy and wants to minimize the number of brush strokes it takes to paint each canvas.
 *
 * Abbreviating each color to a single uppercase letter, Karel would write the stripe pattern red-green-blue-green-red as "RGBGR"
 * (quotes added for clarity). It would take him three brush strokes to paint this pattern. The first stroke would cover the entire
 * canvas in red (RRRRR). The second stroke would leave a band of red on either side and fill in the rest with green (RGGGR).
 * The final brush stroke would fill in the blue stripe in the center (RGBGR).
 *
 * Given a stripe pattern stripes as a String, calculate the minimum number of brush strokes required to paint that pattern.
