 *
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
 * compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
 * For example, Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.
 *
 * Sol:
 *  1. find the highest elevation
 *  2. scan from left to highest, and right to highest, if found a range could trap water,
 *     next equals or higher one than prev one, calculate how many water could trap.
 *  3. during calculate, cal the total area, and delete the blocked area.
 *
 * Tricks:
 *  1. the area(i, j) = min(i, j) * (j-i+1) - blocks(i+1 ~j-1)
 *  2. Simply the searching from find the max.
 *  3. Scan from left/right to center/max.
