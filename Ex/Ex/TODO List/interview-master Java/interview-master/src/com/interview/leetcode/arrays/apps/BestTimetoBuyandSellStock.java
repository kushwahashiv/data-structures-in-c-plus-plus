 * Say you have an array prices[] for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
 *
 * 1: You may complete only one transaction.  {@link #oneTrans(int[])}
 * 2: You may complete multiple transactions. {@link #multiTrans(int[])}
 * 3: You may complete at most two transactions. {@link #oneOrTwoTrans(int[])}
 *
 * From LeetCode

 *
 * Tricks:
 *   1. define a simplest and clear calculation method for the variable you interested (profit)
 *   2. transform the problem to a simpler question:
 *          find a break point day i, make one transaction before day i and one after day i.
 *   3. keeping left and right sols, and using left and right to create whole solution.
 *   3. using dynamic programming to solve duplicate cases.
