 * There is k parenthesis, write code to calculate how many permutations could have.
 * For 2 parenthesis, there is 2 permutations: ()() and (()).
 * This problem is the same as:
 *      1. there is N non-duplicate number, how many different sequences when pushing these numbers to a stack.
 *      2. given N non-duplicate number, how many different binary tree could be built.
 *      3. given an N edge convex polygon, how many different way to using non-cross diagonal line to cut polygon into triangle.
 * It's the Catalan number: h(0)=1,h(1)=1, the recursive definition isï¼š
 *      h(n)= h(0)*h(n-1)+h(1)*h(n-2) + ... + h(n-1)h(0) (n>=2)
