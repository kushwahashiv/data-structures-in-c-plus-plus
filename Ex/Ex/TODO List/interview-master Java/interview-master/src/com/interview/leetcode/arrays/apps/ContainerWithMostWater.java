 *
 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
 * n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines,
 * which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 * Note: You may not slant the container.
 *
 * Sol:
 *    the container space: container(i,j) = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i + 1)
 *    to maximal the space, should start with wider container, i = 0, j = length - 1.
 *    the container space is determined by min, so if i < j, need move to find a bigger i, and when i > j, need move to find a bigger j.
 *    so scan the height, always move the smaller one to a bigger one than the other vertical lines.
 *
 * Tricks:
 *    1. define how to calculate the variable needed, and how to maximize or minimize.
 *    2. consider when will get a bigger or smaller case, and use it to simply the search process.
 *    3. use two pointer to searching from the two end to center.
