/**
 * You have a tree consisting of N vertices numbered 1 to N.
 *
 * Initially each edge has a value equal to zero. You have to first perform M1 operations and then answer M2 queries.
 * Note you have to first perform all the operations and then answer all queries after all operations have been done.
 *
 * Operations are defined by:
 * A B C D: On the path between nodes numbered A and B increase the value of each edge by 1, except for those edges
 * which occur on the path between C and D. Note that there is an unique path between every pair of nodes ie. we don't consider
 * values on edges for finding the path. All four values given in input will be distinct.
 *
 * Queries are of the following type:
 * E F: Print the sum of values of all the edges on the path between two distinct nodes E and F. Again the path will be unique.
 *
 * Given the total node number and the edges between nodes.
 * Given a set of update operations to update the tree.
 * Need find our the queries result.
